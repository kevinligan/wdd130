        <img src="images/profile.png" alt="Hello, my name is Kevin Ligan" width="200">
        <p>Hi there! I'm Kevin Ligan, and I hail from the charming Negros Occidental province in the Philippines. My world revolves around my loving family â€“ I'm a proud husband and a father of two lively boys. Our days are filled with laughter, especially when we're outdoors, riding my trusty motorbike and enjoying quality time together.

            At the moment, I'm on an exciting educational journey at BYUI, where I'm pursuing a degree in BS Software Development. It's a path filled with promise and opportunities to learn and grow.
            
            However, with family responsibilities on my shoulders, I'm currently in search of a job to become a working student. This will allow me to provide for my family's needs while dedicating myself to my studies. It's a balancing act, but I'm determined to make it work because my family's happiness and future mean the world to me.
            
            Now that you know a bit about me, I'd love to hear your story. What brings you joy and fulfillment in life?</p>
